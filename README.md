- Model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
- Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.
- Review survived rate using `percentiles=[.61, .62]` and Parch distribution using `percentiles=[.75, .8]`
- Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.

## Score
Best Score in Random Forest and Decesion Trees (86.76)

Decision Tree and Random Forest score the same, we should choose to use Random Forest as they correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
